#Intro to Python - Print Statements & Taking User Input

#This is a comment. Comments are used to explain code. They are not executed by the computer.


#print statements -> print() is the syntax. Print statements are used to display text on the screen.
print("Hi! What's your name?") #The text always has to be in quotes.


#taking user input -> input() is the syntax. Input statements are used to take input from the user.
name = input() #'name' is a variable. Variables are used to store data. In this case, we are storing the user's name.

#concatenation -> '+' is the syntax. Concatenation is used to combine two strings. Strings are text.
print("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")

#Keep in mind, lines run in order. The computer will run the first line, then the second, then the third, etc.
#Exercise: Write a program that takes the user's name and age as input and displays it on the screen.
#Hint: You will need to use two input statements and two print statements.
